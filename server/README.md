# Blogging Platform

## Overview

This project is a simple blogging platform where users can create, view, and manage blog posts. The platform is built using the following technologies:

- **Frontend**: React.js with TypeScript
- **State Management**: Context API or Redux Toolkit
- **Backend**: Node.js with Express
- **Database**: PostgreSQL with TypeORM or Prisma
- **Authentication**: JWT-based authentication for user login and registration


### Prerequisites

- Node.js (>=14.x)
- PostgreSQL

### Backend Setup

1. Clone the repository:
    ```bash
    git clone <repository-url>
    cd blogz/server
    ```

2. Install dependencies:
    ```bash
    npm install
    ```

3. Set up environment variables:
    Create a `.env` file in the `server` directory and add the following variables:
    ```env
    DATABASE_URL=postgresql://username:password@localhost:5432/blogz
    JWT_SECRET=your_jwt_secret
    ```

4. Run database migrations:
    ```bash
    npx prisma migrate dev
    ```

5. Start the backend server:
    ```bash
    npm run dev
    ```

### Frontend Setup

1. Navigate to the `client` directory:
    ```bash
    cd ../blogz-ui
    ```

2. Install dependencies:
    ```bash
    npm install
    ```

3. Start the frontend development server:
    ```bash
    npm start
    ```

## Approach

### Frontend

The frontend is built using React.js with TypeScript for type safety. State management is handled using Context API or Redux Toolkit. The UI is designed to be responsive and user-friendly.

### Backend

The backend is built using Node.js with Express. PostgreSQL is used as the database, and TypeORM or Prisma is used for ORM. JWT-based authentication is implemented for secure user login and registration.

### Deployment

For deployment, the frontend can be deployed on Vercel, and the backend can be deployed on Railway or Render.
